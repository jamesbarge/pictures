# Align AGENTS.md with CLAUDE.md guidance

**PR**: TBD
**Date**: 2026-02-02

## Changes
- Replaced the lightweight `AGENTS.md` content with a fuller ruleset aligned to `CLAUDE.md`.
- Added explicit sections for:
  - branch/commit/PR workflow expectations,
  - scraper safety and data integrity rules,
  - database cleanup constraints,
  - key files and common commands,
  - code conventions and testing requirements.
- Retained the Tessl-managed rule include at the end of `AGENTS.md`.

## Impact
- Gives Codex and Claude a more consistent project policy baseline.
- Reduces ambiguity during implementation and review work.
- Improves odds that AI-assisted changes follow the same operational and testing standards.
