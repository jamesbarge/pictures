# Changelog Archive

Detailed change logs live in this directory as one file per shipped PR/change.

## Naming Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

## Workflow
- Add a summary entry to `RECENT_CHANGES.md` (top of file)
- Add a detailed entry file in `changelogs/`
- Keep `RECENT_CHANGES.md` trimmed to ~20 entries; keep full history here

## Retrieval Tips
- For latest context: read `RECENT_CHANGES.md`
- For implementation details: open the matching file in this directory
